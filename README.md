## 🏗️ Architecture

Kestrel DB is built as an Electron application with three main processes:

### Main Process (`src/main/`)

- Window management and app lifecycle
- IPC communication setup
- Native OS integration

### Preload Script (`src/preload/`)

- Secure bridge between main and renderer processes
- Exposes Electron APIs via `contextBridge`

### Renderer Process (`src/renderer/`)

- React 19 application with TypeScript
- State management with Zustand
- Styling with Tailwind CSS v4
- Monaco Editor for SQL editing
- TanStack Table for data grids

## 🎨 Tech Stack

- **Electron** - Desktop application framework
- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Styling
- **Monaco Editor** - SQL editor with autocomplete
- **Zustand** - State management
- **TanStack Table** - Data grid virtualization
